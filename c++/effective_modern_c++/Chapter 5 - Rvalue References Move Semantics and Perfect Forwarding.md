## Item 23: Understand std::move and std::forward

- `std::move` performs an unconditional cast to an rvalue. In and of itself, it doesn’t move anything.
- `std::forward` casts its argument to an rvalue only if that argument is bound to an rvalue.
- Neither `std::move` nor `std::forward` do anything at runtime.

---

## Item 24: Distinguish universal references from rvalue references

- If a function template parameter has type T&& for a deduced type T, or if an object is declared using `auto&&`, the parameter or object is a universal reference.
- If the form of the type declaration isn’t precisely type&&, or if type deduction does not occur, type&& denotes an rvalue reference.
- Universal references correspond to rvalue references if they’re initialized with rvalues. They correspond to lvalue references if they’re initialized with lvalues.

---

## Item 25: Use std::move on rvalue references, std::forward on universal references

- Apply `std::move` to rvalue references and `std::forward` to universal references the last time each is used.
- Do the same thing for rvalue references and universal references being returned from functions that return by value.
- Never apply `std::move` or `std::forward` to local objects if they would otherwise be eligible for the return value optimization.

---

## Item 26: Avoid overloading on universal references

- Overloading on universal references almost always leads to the universal reference overload being called more frequently than expected.
- Perfect-forwarding constructors are especially problematic, because they’re typically better matches than copy constructors for non-const lvalues, and they can hijack derived class calls to base class copy and move constructors.

---

## Item 27: Familiarize yourself with alternatives to overloading on universal references

- Alternatives to the combination of universal references and overloading include the use of distinct function names, passing parameters by lvalue reference-to-const, passing parameters by value, and using tag dispatch.
- Constraining templates via `std::enable_if` permits the use of universal references and overloading together, but it controls the conditions under which compilers may use the universal reference overloads.
- Universal reference parameters often have efficiency advantages, but they typically have usability disadvantages.

---

## Item 28: Understand reference collapsing

- Reference collapsing occurs in four contexts: template instantiation, `auto` type generation, creation and use of `typedef`s and alias declarations, and `decltype`.
- When compilers generate a reference to a reference in a reference collapsing context, the result becomes a single reference. If either of the original references is an lvalue reference, the result is an lvalue reference. Otherwise it’s an rvalue reference.
- Universal references are rvalue references in contexts where type deduction distinguishes lvalues from rvalues and where reference collapsing occurs.

---

## Item 29: Assume that move operations are not present, not cheap, and not used

- Assume that move operations are not present, not cheap, and not used.
- In code with known types or support for move semantics, there is no need for assumptions.

---

## Item 30: Familiarize yourself with perfect forwarding failure cases

- Perfect forwarding fails when template type deduction fails or when it deduces the wrong type.
- The kinds of arguments that lead to perfect forwarding failure are braced initializers, null pointers expressed as 0 or NULL, declaration-only integral const static data members, template and overloaded function names, and bitfields.
